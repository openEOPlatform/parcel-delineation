# Parcel delineation
This is an [openEO](https://openeo.org/) example for delineating agricultural parcels based on a neural network, using Sentinel-2 input data.

The example focuses on the inference step, using a trained model. It demonstrates data loading and preprocessing, 
inference, and finally producing vector data as a result.

The example serves as a technology demonstration for openEO, and is not intended for use in another context.
